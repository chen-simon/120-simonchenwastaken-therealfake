### UI/Frontend:

Three options we had for the front end were React(developed by Facebook), Vue, and Angular (developed by Google). React is the most popular front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces and can also render on the server using Node.js. React ensures faster loading by being able to design what to render and in what scenario, there is the option for separation of data and presentation, single files can contain markup and logic, and since it is based on JavaScript, it is much easier for our team in terms of learning curve (as we are already familiar with JavaScript). Downsides to using React are that it’s technically just a library and not a complete framework, it is not possible to implement the MVC architecture with React, and it is not enough to make a web app without the support of other libraries. Angular is a component based front-end development framework built on TypeScript which includes a collection of well-integrated libraries that include features like routing, forms management, client-server communication. Angular is a mature framework, but it requires a steep learning curve. Vue.js is a young open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. Vue has in-detail documentation and provides flexibility and simplicity for app development. However, the community support is not as wide as Angular or React, which makes it concerning if there is uncertainty that is not addressed in the documentations or online. In the end, we chose to use React as it would have a much easier learning curve for the short amount of time the project was expected to be due by. React has been a very popular framework for almost half a decade meaning large amounts of support from the community and documentation and would allow us the flexibility to specifically choose which other libraries would be most optimal for the app rather than being locked into the framework.


### Logic/Backend: 

The three considerations we had were JavaScript, Python, and Java. While our team is familiar with Python and Java, JavaScript was more appealing as it was the language we both used most recently. It can be used for the backend and at the same time we would also be using it in our front end with React. In comparison, Python and Java are not as versatile and are only used for backend programming. Java has a high level of stability and maturity, resulting in it being used by large banks and corporations that have had projects over decades. While JavaScript dominated in the user interface side of web apps, it is still in the beginning for backend development until NodeJS is used much more.  Python is also pretty mature as high-profile companies, like Google and Facebook, also use it to extend JavaScript and Java. But, Python comes more to shine when it revolves around fields of artificial intelligence and data science. JavaScript and Java not only can be used in web development, but are also seen in the development of apps, specifically Java is the go to choice for Android development. In terms of popularity by the Stack Overflow 2021 Developer Survey, the most popular was JavaScript with 64.96, 3rd was Python with 48.24% and lastly Java was 5th with 35.35%. This ordering between the three was the same for All Respondents and when it was just Professional Developers. In terms of speed Java is has the most optimized speed, next comes JavaScript, then followed by Python. For performance it truly depends on use cases, Java has inbuilt multi-threading, Node.js has the V8, and Python is not particularly the best compared to the other two. Javascript is quite scalable which dynamic processes run to keep up to speed and performance while the solution expands. Java is scalable but the process is much more complex depending on further understanding of multiple components, etc. As python is a dynamically typed scripting languages it is hard to maintain when scaling, the code is interpreted at run time like plain text. Our team chose to use JavaScript as we both we familiar with it and used it recently. But also the point that it would be the same language as our frontend work meant less potential for syntax confusions or errors causing our whole project to not work. We used this language with Firebase, which is a backend-as-a-serve app development platform providing backend services.


### Database: 

Three options we had for the database were MongoDB, Firestore (Firebase), and MySQL. Both MongoDB and Firestore are NoSQL databases, which means data is stored in the same way JavaScript handles objects, which is JSON-like document models and schemas. MongoDB and Firebase are built for ease of application development and horizontal scalability. MySQL uses tables as entities, while MongoDB and Firestore use documents as entities. MySQL is mature, with regular releases, patches, and a large developer community. This is a very similar story for Firestore and MongoDB, MongoDB has been around since 2007 and many large organizations use it so it’s constantly meeting new demands. MongoDB allows for any query language of your choosing to retrieve data, but Firestore has a specific method and API calls to do so. MySQL also allows for many choices for the query language. In addition MySQL is compatible with more systems because of its time and on the market and mobility. In terms of popularity, MySQL came out at the most popular on the Stack Overflow 2021 survey (50.18%), when MongoDB at 4th place with 27.7% and then Firebase was 8th with 16.17%.  While MongoDB is able to respond to requests faster, Firebase compensates for its extra encryption associated with it. Both MongoDB and Firestore are fully managed services which means devs get more time to work with the data rather than the server or infrastructure. Mongo has automated daily database backups while it must be manually implemented and configured by the administrator for Firestore. Firestore has the ability to update and listen to changes in real time. This can be done in Mongo but requires a lot of groundwork to begin doing so. Firestore is included in Firebase, which makes it simpler for developers to spend more time to focus on coding. As we chose to use Firebase for our backend, we chose to use Firestore for the database as it was already bundled with it.
